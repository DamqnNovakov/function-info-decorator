# FunctionInfo Decorator

The `FunctionInfo` class is a Python utility that provides valuable insights into the performance and memory usage of a function. By using the `my_decorator` method, this tool helps you analyze the functionâ€™s execution time, the size of the function, and the sizes of its arguments.

## Features

- **Execution Time**: Measure the time taken for a function to execute.
- **Memory Usage**: Calculate and report the memory size of a function and its arguments.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides a breakdown of memory usage for different argument types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, etc.).
